Using folder C:\temp\git\cwvaContent\ttl\topics


Ttl2Tsh

TTL is read from the folder
For each ttl file, 
If any existing, related tsh file is older
tsh translation to respective tsh file is created
No backup for previously existing tsh files created
If tsh is more recent an error is thrown
The ttl file can be touched to make it more recent, if necessary


Tsh2Ttl

Tsh is read from the folder
Any ttl with the same root name as a tsh is backed up
E.g., for topics.tsh and topics.ttl
topics.ttl -> topics.ttl.{file-last-modified-dateTime)


Scenarios

1. tsh exists, no ttl exists
	Tsh2Ttl (typical), create ttl

2. ttl exists, no tsh
	Ttl2Tsh (typical), create tsh

3. tsh exists and is older than ttl
	Ttl2Tsh (typical), restoring tsh for new edits
	Tsh2Ttl (unusual), error--can't overwrite newer ttl from old tsh 

4. tsh exists and is newer than ttl
	Ttl2Tsh (blocked), error--can't overwrite newer tsh from old ttl
	Tsh2Ttl (typical), tsh is modified and ready for ttl, old ttl backed up
